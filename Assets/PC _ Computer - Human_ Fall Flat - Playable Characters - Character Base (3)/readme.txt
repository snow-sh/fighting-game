There are a few different variations of the model included:

HumanBody.obj -- A version of the model without deformations. UV maps are intact, and is therefore useful for making skins for the game.
HumanBody.fbx -- The model ripped directly from Unity
HumanBody_Alt.fbx -- A cleaned up version of the model that appears to play nicer with some programs.
